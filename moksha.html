<div class="message incoming_message"><div class="text"><span>Found an interesting note from Ishavasya khandartha of Raghavendra tirtha on sarupya moksha. Some background:
There are 4 types of moksha. The lowest and the first one being 'Saarupya'. Others are salokya, sanidhya and sayujya.
Saarupya is generally defined as the kind of moksha where a jiva gets the form similar to that of Lord. For example: A Jiva when he gets moksha, get 4 hands with shankha-chakra-gada-padma.
For the 7th verse of Ishavasya upanishad
 'स पर्यागात्-शुक्रं अकायं‍ अव्रणं ...' ("a Jnani attains Lord who is free from sorrow..")
Raghavendra tirtha in His khandartha explaining Jayatirtha's teeka, says 
एवं भूत-हरि-सारूप्य-लक्षणां  तद्गतिं गतस्य शोकाद्यभावो युक्त इति भावः
Lord is shukra, akaya, avrana i.e., He is free from sorrow, delusion etc. A jnani attains such a Lord and hence that jnani also becomes free from sorrow, delusion. 
Attaining Lord's Saarupya (form similar to Lord) is moksha. 
Since the jnani/devotee attains the Lord and obtains freedom from sorrow/delusion, he is termed as having obtained the saarupya of Lord. (the saarupya of the absence of sorrow - jiva attains a form which is similar to the Lord in terms of absence of sorrow/delusion).                        
ಪರಮಾತ್ಮನ ಸಾರೂಪ್ಯವೇ ಮೋಕ್ಷವು. ಪರಮಾತ್ಮನಲ್ಲಿ ಶೋಕ-ಮೊಹಾದಿಗಳು ಇಲ್ಲದಿರುವುದರಿಂದ ಅವನನ್ನು ಹೊಂದಿದ ಭಕ್ತನಿಗೂ ಶೋಕಮೋಹಾದಿ ಅಭಾವವೆಂಬ ಸಾರೂಪ್ಯವು ಉಂಟಾಗುತ್ತದೆ.
Thus saarupya is not only in terms of the 'form', it is also defined in terms of other attributes of Lord which a jiva obtains                        
So, saarupya is not necessarily a 4-hand-shankha-chakra-gada form, but is actually a form which is 'free from sorrow'.</span></div><div class="remote-resource"><span>Girish Prabhu</span> (<span>919731211477@s.whatsapp.net</span>)</div><div class="timestamp"><span>2017.03.20 - 09:24:41</span></div></div>

One correction on the 4 types of mokshas:
saarupya, saalokya, saamipya and saayujya are the 4. Saarupya being the lowest kind of moksha and saayujya being the highest obtained by Devatas. 
There is gradation even within the categories. Rujus get sarvaanga saayujya of Lord, whereas other devatas get sayujya of few body parts of Lord</span></div><div class="remote-resource"><span>Girish Prabhu</span> (<span>919731211477@s.whatsapp.net</span>)</div><div class="timestamp"><span>2017.03.20 - 10:48:06</span></div></div>

<div class="message incoming_message"><div class="text"><span>But saarupya seems to be a generic term from what Girishanna has explained above from Rayaru's khandartha...when we consider the fact that every higher type of mukti is inclusive of the lower type(sayujya muktas have saarupya also and so on) what Rayaru has said becomes more clear and relevant</span></div><div class="remote-resource"><span>Gururaj Bhandarkar</span> (<span>918892775035@s.whatsapp.net</span>)</div><div class="timestamp"><span>2017.03.20 - 11:05:31</span></div></div>
<div class="message incoming_message"><div class="text"><span>Yes. Manushyottamas are generally termed for getting saarupya moksha. 
As Guru said, even higher devatas get saarupya. 
So, lets say 4 muktas M1, M2, M3 and M4
M1 gets saarupya
M2 gets saalokya, M3 saamipya and M4 saayujya. 
M2 who has got saalokya also gets saarupya. So M2 = salokya+saarupya
M3 who gets samipya also gets salokya and sarupya. M3 = samipya + salokya + sarupya
Similarly, M4 = sayujya + samipya + salokya + sarupya
Devatas belong to M4 is the highest category jiva. 
Again among devatas, M4, there are categories like Rujus who get further enhanced kind of sayujya.</span></div><div class="remote-resource"><span>Girish Prabhu</span> (<span>919731211477@s.whatsapp.net</span>)</div><div class="timestamp"><span>2017.03.20 - 12:04:45</span></div></div>

According to Vaishnava scriptures, there are four types of salvation known as salokya, samipya, sarupya, and sayujya. This is purely a devotee’s idea, of closeness to God by degrees of nearness.

To live in the same domain as God is one kind of attainment. If God is in heaven, you also are in heaven; you may not be very near God, you may be far away, but you are in the same kingdom; where the king rules, that country is your abode also; you may not be able to see the king but you are happy that you are in the same land which is ruled by the king. This is salokya mukti. This is also a great thing. After all, you are in the Land of God though you may not see God.

Samipya means nearness to God; you are living just by the side of the Ruler of the country; you will feel some elation – the King’s Palace is just here and I am here. Though you have nothing to do with that Palace, you will gain nothing by the nearness, but the mind will say ‘I am so near the Palace of the King; He is here only!’ Thus, nearness to God also is a stage in liberation. This is samipya, closeness.

Still greater freedom is sarupya, assuming the same form of God; you become an ambassador of God. God has given you the powers which He wields. The ambassador has practically all the powers of the kingdom which he represents; he can speak for the whole country of which he is the ambassador. The Vaishnava scriptures say sarupya means not merely becoming an ambassador, because the ambassador does not himself look like the king, though he can be adored and invested with all the paraphernalia of the king also, there is something more here. In Vaikuntha, Abode of Vishnu, Narayana, they shine like Vishnu Himself. When you see the attendant of God, you cannot know whether He is God Himself or is an attendant; he will shine like God Himself, though he is not God. This is called sarupya. The last one is sayujya, merging in God, the Highest attainment. All these come under what is known as saguna Attainment, meditation on God as adorned with all the good qualities – kalyana guna sampanna; ananta koti kalyana guna sampanna – all the blessed things are there in God. Here ‘merging’ is something like merging, union of milk and water, though looking one, still not one.</span></div><div class="remote-resource"><span>Sanjaykumar Shenoy</span> (<span>918056280552@s.whatsapp.net</span>)</div><div class="timestamp"><span>2017.03.20 - 14:00:45</span></div></div>

<div class="message incoming_message"><div class="text"><span>How if we understand it like this? 
When sarupya is being stated as the basic most type of mukti(like in Vaikunta varnane) it is referring to jivas above manushyottamas who literally get forms similar to purusha and stree rupas of Lord respectively...but when saalokya is being stated as the basic one it is including trunaadi jivas also, as Lord is with muktas in whichever loka they are...and the same saalokya can be understood for jivas above manushyottamas as specifically living with the Lord in *Vaikuntaadi tridhamas* which would then make it higher than sarupya...</span></div><div class="remote-resource"><span>Gururaj Bhandarkar</span> (<span>918892775035@s.whatsapp.net</span>)</div><div class="timestamp"><span>2017.03.20 - 22:56:00</span></div></div>
<div class="message outgoing_message"><div class="text"><span>Some alternate thinking here - And this seems to make sense to me -
Tell if it makes no sense to you 🙂

The primary reason we are arriving at the conclusion that saarupya is the lowest is because everybody gets saarupya.

But everybody gets it to *some extent per yogyata* regardless of whether they get other types of moxa.
In this sense everybody gets saarupya.

However there is clear-cut demarcation between saalokya, saamipya and saayuja.
With those who got the latter also have the former.
In this sense the gradation is only 3. However their common varying characteristic is saarupya
Brahma gets more saarupya than Shesha and so on.</span></div><div class="timestamp"><span>2017.03.20 - 22:58:12</span></div></div>
<div class="message outgoing_message"><div class="text"><span>IMHO now i feel comparing saarupya as a moxa category to other 3 well defined categories is like comparing apples with oranges</span></div><div class="timestamp"><span>2017.03.20 - 22:59:14</span></div></div>

<div class="message outgoing_message"><div class="text"><span>If Saarupya is akin to sweetness. 
Those who get Apple (Saalokya) get less sweetness
Those who get banana(Samipya) get more sweetness
Those who get Mango (Sayujya) get max sweetness
And those who get Ripe Alphonso (Saarstya) get the best sweetness

Everybody gets sweetness (saarupya) at varying degrees.

But try going to market and ask for 1 kg of sweetness. How does that sound? Cant happen right?
Similarly saarupya as a *defined* category of moxa without any other accompanying 3 categories is abstract.
This is my theory at the moment. Based on all the posts and counters we see.

<div class="message outgoing_message"><div class="text"><span>Without sounding to repeat myself : My point is 
Saarupya as a defined category of moxa doesnt sound right at all.
Sarupya is that varying characteristic (of jnana and ananda etc and their expressiveness) which shows ascending characteristic across three other defined moxa categories.

Saying Saarupya is less than any of Saalokya Samipya sounds as incorrect as saying 
sweetness is less than apple or 
sweetness is less than banana
And begs the question *whose* sweetness.
And that *whose* is the 3 concrete categories of moxa - salokya, samipya, sayujya in that increasing order of sweetness</span></div><div class="timestamp"><span>2017.03.20 - 23:13:41</span></div></div>

Salient Points
1. Order is indeed Saalokya Saarupatva Saamipya Saayujya. It is specified in BSB and TP as the order
2. Salokya does not mean being in Vaikunta. Since Narayana has vyaapti everywhere - every loka is Narayana loka. Being in any one of the loka is Saalokya
3. Next one is NOT Saarupya. It is Saroopatva. It is not taking the form of Vishnu. It is being in samaana roopa loka (needs more jijnasa on what it is)

<div class="message incoming_message"><div class="text"><span>What happens during the process of mukti? ..After you know the different ways in which different levels of souls attain to that state where even praarabdha is also over , they wait in different lokas for chaturmukha brahma's ayushya to get over. Then all these mukti yogya jivas enter brahma's udara through different routes. These you have to study. After that brahma along with other fit jivas takes bath in viraja river and enters Vishnu's udara, where Lakshmidevi acts as a dvaara (door). Once next creation starts EVERY mukta jiva (those who got mukti in just previous creation and all earlier creations) visits Narayana in Shveta dvipa. 
After that ALL these muktas go to their *designed or allotted* places and enjoy till next destruction or mahaa pralaya. This is obly a broad description.

<div class="message incoming_message"><div class="text"><span>As saamipya has to be there at all the places where muktas enjoy, SriHari will be near to those muktas in bhuloka also.
Please note that there will be a strong doubt. How can muktas exist in bhuloka etc which is of trigunatmaka prakRiti? The simple answer is that the common characteristic of muktas is that they are not bound anymore by these triguNas. So even if they exist in bhuloka etc they are not touched by the praakritic gunas.</span></div><div class="remote-resource"><span>Vishnu Shanbhag</span> (<span>919880241668@s.whatsapp.net</span>)</div><div class="timestamp"><span>2017.03.21 - 09:01:36</span></div></div>

What can possibly be construed from these evidences is that the saarupya described by Rajaru is pertaining to Vaikunta only as the work itself concentrates mainly on describing Vaikunta and not moksha in general....it probably means that among muktas of the Vaikunta loka, sarupya is a common type for all of them there; this would also fit in well with the description of people getting confused as to who is Vishnu etc.....however there is a serious hurdle in this understanding; saalokya should also be common to all if it's Vaikunta only which would go against the  comparison of sarupya with lavana<span class="emoticon_1f615"></span></span></div><div class="remote-resource"><span>Gururaj Bhandarkar</span> (<span>918892775035@s.whatsapp.net</span>)</div><div class="timestamp"><span>2017.03.21 - 17:07:27</span></div></div>

1. Salokya is the most common form of moxa.
Aren't vriksha, khaga uragadi jivas found in other lokas as all these mukta truna khagadi jivas need not be located in vaikunta. And yet they'll be said to have saalokya. 
2. Saroopya/sarooptva comes next.
Doubt-- a) yet we find in VV. that saaroopya is the most common type as given by the ex. of lavana in shakas. So does a mukta & yogya jiva in other lokas too satisfy saaroopya type? Or is it just that the yogya purushas located in vaikunta have saaroopya?
b) Why are muktas found only in bhoo & upper lokas? Why not in lower ones like Atala... as these to are punya lokas?

Then from time to time does his roopa change? With achintyadbhuta shakti of Srihari. Or is it just like in sansara where he has ananta roopa with poorna jnana bala... (is he the one who is  doing shvasa japa in muktas under him?) How to understand this? Or is it possible that he attains the sukha of a stree in his purusha roopa itself as we know that the ananda is intrinsic?
d) what about mukta garuda sheshas? Will they have both purushakruti & respective khaga uraga forms which seems really impossible as svaroopa is acchedya & abedhya.  Or are they by svaaroopa just that with much more power. (In samsara they have both human & other form  right?)</span></div><div class="remote-resource"><span>Shantala Isloor</span> (<span>919900815037@s.whatsapp.net</span>)</div><div class="timestamp"><span>2017.03.22 - 13:22:32</span></div></div>

class="message incoming_message"><div class="text"><span>Srikanth :Some alternate thinking here - And this seems to make sense to me -Tell if it makes no sense to you 🙂The primary reason we are arriving at the conclusion that saarupya is the lowest is because everybody gets saarupya.But everybody gets it to *some extent per yogyata* regardless of whether they get other types of moxa.In this sense everybody gets saarupya.However there is clear-cut demarcation between saalokya, saamipya and saayuja.With those who got the latter also have the former.In this sense the gradation is only 3. However their common varying characteristic is saarupyaBrahma gets more saarupya than Shesha and so on.</span></div><div class="remote-resource"><span>Girish Prabhu</span> (<span>919731211477@s.whatsapp.net</span>)</div><div class="timestamp"><span>2017.03.22 - 17:24:26</span></div></div><div class="message incoming_message"><div class="text"><span>@919845710607  its based on our discussion this morning.

Isn't a mukta having exactly the same form as of Lord, like snake for shesha, pakshi for garuda, an exact saarupya?</span></div><div class="remote-resource"><span>Vishnu Shanbhag</span> (<span>919880241668@s.whatsapp.net</span>)</div><div class="timestamp"><span>2017.03.22 - 22:42:58</span></div></div><div class="message incoming_message"><div class="text"><div><a href="images/moksha/4e25fa37-aa26-4933-a653-dd05ba79556f.jpg" class="preview"><img src="data:image/jpeg;base64,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"></a></div></div><div class="remote-resource"><span>Prathvish Bhat</span> (<span>919945820316@s.whatsapp.net</span>)</div><div class="timestamp"><span>2017.03.23 - 20:25:31</span></div></div><div class="message incoming_message"><div class="text"><span>Found an interesting thing about bimba pratibimbatva..
